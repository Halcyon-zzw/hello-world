# hello-world
my frist repository,just a test

I'm a junior student.
Today,I first touched GitHub.
Before I know nothing about GitHub.
The teacher around has always recommended us to use github.
Now I have a preliminary understanding of github.
I am very excited and worried,beacuse my English is very bad.
And all on github are in English.
This is a big obstacle to my study on github.
Now I'm looking at the introductory guide which is next to Google's translation.
Including the document I'm writing is also translated with translation tools.
So I think, good programmers don't necessarily need good English,but good English will better help you become a good programmer.
